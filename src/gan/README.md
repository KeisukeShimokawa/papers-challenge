# GAN

In this section, I reproduce the paper on GAN.

I try to keep the source code as clean as possible when I reproduce the implementation, and I refer to official implementations with clean code, such as [mimicry](https://github.com/kwotsin/mimicry).

## Implmentation List

- [x] FQGAN
    - [ ] reproduce the original paper result.
